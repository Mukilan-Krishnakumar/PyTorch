Hey, I am Mukilan Krishnakumar and welcome to my repository for learning PyTorch. These notebooks are more so a learning tool for me rather than a teaching one. I am learning PyTorch from variety of sources but primarily from PyTorch docs. As of learning (From 11th July, 2023), I am using PyTorch 2.0.1.
